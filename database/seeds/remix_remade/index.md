During August 2020, MSL Digital commissioned three creatives, Rebecca Child, Mary Hooper and Juliet Russell, in response to [A Derelict Chorale by Chris Thorpe-Tracey](https://smart-heritage.co.uk/narrative/4/event/23)

Rebecca Child is a prop and puppet maker. She has worked in theatre, film and live performance with a focus on community arts and outdoor events. In response to Chris’s songs Rebecca made a stop motion animation called [‘Sliding Light‘](https://youtu.be/mBBDt9k7nJ4).

Mary Hooper is a visual artist working in digital and mixed media. Mary has created a digital sound and video piece, [‘Pick and Unpick‘](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0N_7Vu-f2g), based on the song, ‘Doin The Rope-Walk Tangle’.

Juliet Russell is a composer, singer and director. Juliet has created an acapella piece of music, [‘A Town was Silent‘](https://youtu.be/ztUMzMwhzvM), using contemporary beatbox, harmonies, breath and rhythm.

Sam Sharples’ film about [Remixed & Remade](https://youtu.be/I8Gw8tYl-PI) includes interviews with all three artists and sets them in context in Covid times in Hastings.
