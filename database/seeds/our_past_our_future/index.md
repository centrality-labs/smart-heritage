During November and December 2019, 12 creative people of all ages met at Hastings Museum and at Rock House in central Hastings to research the history of the America Ground, three streets that witnessed fascinating struggles between people and the Crown back in 1820's England.

Funded by [The Space](https://www.thespace.org/) the group took part in creative writing, digital animation and Wikimedia
classes. Each member of the group made at least one or two pieces of digital content inspired by stories from the America Ground.

These can be viewed below, or found on [MSL YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3TEsxvcy0cEkuYrEFwBUGA/videos) and on the [MSL website](http://www.mslprojects.co.uk/our-past-our-future-developing-historical-sources-for-creative-inspiration/).
