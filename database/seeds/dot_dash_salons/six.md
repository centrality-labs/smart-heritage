Devised and hosted by Kevin Grist of SparkedEcho From hand-washing and NHS clapping, to birdsong and Zoom glitches, our sound world at home has truly changed. Sound artist and musician Kevin Grist worked with co-creators in Hastings to remotely sample the lockdown using their phones, resulting in a composition that evolved over time. In this one hour video discussion, Kevin and co-creators will reflect on collaborating remotely, unpick the work track-by-track, and show a live demo of the online platform Soundtrap. Throughout June and July 2020, as part of Dot Dash festival, audiences were invited to participate in eight one-hour weekly Zoom Salons exploring the fascinating history of Hastingsâ€™ America Ground.
