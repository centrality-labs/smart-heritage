Writer and performer Rosanna Lowe has been collaborating with ‘broken folk’ duo Lunatraktors and psychedelic folk duo Rokurokubi to explore sounds of the fair and songs inspired by fairgrounds and their attractions. In this one hour video, Rosanna’s guests are Clair Le Couteur and Carli of Lunatraktors and Rose and Edmund Io of Rokurokubi. Fairs have inspired a deliciously diverse tradition of folk songs from bawdy ballads, to the gentle romance of The Hiring Fair, to the mysterious herbal coding of Scarborough Fair. Like travelling fairs and associated gypsy and traveller culture, folk songs often up sticks and shift scenery, lyric, melody and meaning.
