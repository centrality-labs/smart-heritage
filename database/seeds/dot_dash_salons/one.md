This one hour video was devised and hosted by Rosanna Lowe with Alice Denny and Robbie C Stedman. The original works for Ordinary Extraordinary were commissioned for MSL’s This Is For Everyone project in September 2019. The sound project for mobile phones introduced real-life stories collected from the streets around Hastings, UK. Everywhere 'ordinary' people are being or doing something a little 'extraordinary’. This was a celebration of tiny tales of local wonder folk, inviting you to experience what it feels like in their shoes. In this video, Ordinary/Extraordinary was revisited, and Robbie read Technicolour Dreamboy and Alice read Alice Through the Looking Glass. Both poems were written by Rosanna Lowe from accounts given to her by Robbie and Alice. Rosanna also reads The Lightning Lady, The Honey Hunger Striker, The Disappearing Headmaster and The Hunger Brothers.
