In this one-hour Zoom interview, musician and composer, Debbie Warren, and historical researcher, Julie Gidlow, talk with Chris Thorpe-Tracey, artist-in-residence in Hastings' America Ground streets during early 2020. During his residency, Chris researched and developed a suite of 10 songs that delve into Hastings’ fractious politics of the early 1800s. The song cycle, called 'A Derelict Chorale,' unearths a rich seam of material, introducing characters and incidents from a seminal part of Hastings’ history, much of it little known, some recently discovered. Chris has been very generous and is sharing the copyright of the work with the town of Hastings - so the next stage of A Derelict Chorale will see the songs opened up to everyone to remake or remix them, in whatever art form people want to use. More details of this will be announced soon.
