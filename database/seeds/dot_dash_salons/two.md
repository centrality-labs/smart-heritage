What happens when the world is turned upside down? How do Hastings festivals like Jack in the Green conjure the same celebratory spirit as Rock Fair from the 1800s? Could Rock Fair ever return? And in these times of sickness, do we need celebration more than ever? All these questions, and more, are explored in Rock Fair and the Carnivalesque, the second of three online Salons led by Rosanna Lowe, part of MSL's Dot Dash online festival in Hastings. In this long-form video, Rosanna introduces some of the ideas for her new work with an exploration of the history, myth and mystery of Hastings fairs and festivities. Rosanna is working with researcher, Julie Gidlow, to develop a new community performance work for production in the America Ground. Rosanna’s other guests are Dr Clair Le Couteur of ‘broken folk’ duo, Lunatraktors, Chris Hare of History People UK, Keith Leech and Heather Leech of Hastings’ Jack in the Green and Steve Roud, folk culture historian and creator of the Roud Folksong index.
