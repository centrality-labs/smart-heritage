Could anyone imagine this? Disaster or opportunity, Covid-19 has changed things suddenly and in ways we never expected. What will happen to the businesses in one small area of Hastings which have been integral to making the historic Trinity Triangle the place it is? Can they re-open as they were, or can they reinvent the status quo offering a different way of doing things? Will appointments apps, social distancing, one-way systems, two at a time restrict business? And where does the ‘creative’ fit into the making of the new landscape? Hastings artist Mary Hooper and her guests discuss whether impossible/difficult might become possible/necessary Mary’s guests are all proprietors of cafes and shops and culture businesses around the central streets of historic Hastings: Alexis Camburn (Two Snakes Tattoo), Nicole Collumb (Greater London Authority) Vicki Duffey (Bullet Café) Kate Rintoul (Home Ground Kitchen), Tim Scullion and Susan McNally (Wow and Flutter), Caoimhe O’Gorman (Heart of Hastings).
