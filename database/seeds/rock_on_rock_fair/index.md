A developing story in three parts intended for community performance, Rosanna Loweâ€™s new performance work is set in the once-upon-a-time rambunctious Hastings Rock Fair.

Elizabethan, Victorian and modern America Ground is the stage for the story of three women in the times of plague and dereliction, to the accompaniment of ancient and contemporary folk music.

This work is in progress. Check the project page on the [MSL website](http://www.mslprojects.co.uk/rock-on-rock-fair/) for news of when it will go live.
