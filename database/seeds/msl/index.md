MSL celebrates individual creativity, community and place. 

We deliver placemaking through cultural interventions, integrating creative work with social, learning and economic objectives.

We create performances, exhibitions and installations that engage and inspire people, and transform communities.

We commission digital artworks, stories and expositions, animating spaces and places.

We offer consultancy support, sharing expertise knowledge and learning.

Recent MSL projects include: **Divertimento for Rope & Strings**, a ground-breaking blend of serious music and circus (2018); **Nursery Crymes**, a partnership with Mischief La-Bas which, following R&D in Hastings, was realised in a sold-out premiere in Glasgow in November 2017, receiving nominations for three Critics Awards for Theatre; **Storylines** (2017), a development of The Alley in Hastings as a reclaimed space for performance, exhibition and community celebration, due to re-open in Spring 2019 (a video from which is included below); **Silence**, a powerful outdoor presentation by Polish company, Teatr Biuro Podróży, alongside a three-day immersive workshop for outdoor arts practitioners in association with 101 Outdoor Arts in Newbury (2016).

MSL also manages digital and learning programmes: **Creative Slam** (Hastings' Creative Spring), which offered digital media (STEAM) holiday learning activity for young people in February 2019; **Hastings' Creative Summer**, an exciting creative media workshop programme for young people in association with the Royal Institution (2018); **Transformations**, a VR exposition of Victorian theatre practice in Alexandra Palace (2016-2018); and **Centenary**, several AR installations for Dover (2014-15). 

In development is a new outdoor touring show, **Strung!**, more **Creative Slam** programmes, **Atelier** and the **Digital Exchange**.
