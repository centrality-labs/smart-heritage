Once a harbour, the area became silted up in great storms in the 13th century. By around 1820 a thousand people in about 200 buildings had ‘squatted’ the eight acres of empty ground beyond the borough boundary - houses, sheds, workshops, stables, warehouses etc.

The area gained one of its names, the America Ground, when the borough attempted to evict the squatters who then declared independence and played the “Stars and Stripes” as a sign of defiance.

When the squatters were evicted in the mid-1830s, the land lay unused until leased by entrepreneur Patrick Robertson in the early 1850s who created Robertson Street, Robertson Terrace, Claremont and Trinity Street.

Claremont was named for Dowager Lady Claremont, a fashion icon of the early 19th century, Robertson Street for its developer and Trinity for Holy Trinity Church.

The area contains 15 listed buildings, including the Grade II Holy Trinity church (HTH) at its centre. Three key local buildings were designed by local architect Henry Ward (1852-1927) – Debenhams, the United Reformed Church, and the Observer Building.
