In 2012, Tim Berners-Lee famously tweeted "This Is For Everyone", in a moment of technological optimism many think is lost to us. MSL want to build on Berners-Lee's big moment by exploring how small-town WiFi could re-open urban channels to the massive variety of audiences found on city streets. 

To do this, MSL commissioned three new digital works by artists Judith Ricketts, Kevin Grist and Rosanna Lowe. Accessible to audiences via mobile phones or tablets during Coastal Currents Festival in the town centre via the town WiFi, the three works preview on 7 September.

Do the commissions make sense on the streets? We’re asking big questions about the value of local connectivity in a one-day event on 23 September including artists, local businesspeople and experts in the digital arts and community digital infrastructure.

After the art commissions, again echoing Berners-Lee, we’re asking something important: "if you could take over the WiFi in your town for social, cultural and economic good, what would you do?" That’s why the event is called "Is This For Everyone?"
