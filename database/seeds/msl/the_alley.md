In 2017 **Storylines** launched The Alley as a new reclaimed space for storytellers, artists and community.

The Alley is a space where the built environment meets the natural one, where the invisible past and the present are embedded in the landscape, but which is largely unknown and poorly used. On the day we had a programme for artists, historians and storytellers who created and presented a series of events for a promenading audience â€“ a show and tell of the history of the place; for a day, bringing it back to life.
