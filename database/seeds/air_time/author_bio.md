Judith is an exhibiting artist, researcher and visiting lecturer in creative coding. She uses the city's immaterial patterns and inter-dependencies to tell stories from data that are related to surveillance, migration and the bio-metric aesthetics of the body. Past projects were created using combinations of facial detection, motion detection, QR codes, photography, sound, and moving image.
