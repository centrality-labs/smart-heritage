air time uses encoded visual markers as sensors in the geo-tagged location of the America Ground to tell an unfolding story from data. 

The markers are designed to reveal immediate parts of the story in up to 60 seconds of Augmented Reality media triggered by audiences. 

The placement of the markers at intersecting points in the space leads us through map coordinates to other places in the urban space where, concealed in the bungaroosh, are other unremembered stories, untold.

**Headphones recommended.**
