Three digital art and storytelling projects test out ways to bring the town streets to life - work by Rosanna Lowe, Judith Ricketts and Kevin Grist

MSL commissioned new exploratory work by three local and regional artists, Judith Ricketts, Kevin Grist and Rosanna Lowe. The work, funded by the National Lottery via Arts Council England, was featured during Coastal Currents Festival and is still principally accessible to audiences online.

After the work went live, the artists reported back on the experience of making their commissions at a one-day event, called ‘Is This For Everyone?’ at St. Mary in the Castle, also funded by Arts Council England and in addition, by the RSA.
