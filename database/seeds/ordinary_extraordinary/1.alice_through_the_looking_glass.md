I was not the conventional father<br />
Or husband<br />
Papoosed, my baby used<br />
To come with me to lectures<br />
Or I'd carry her close in a basket<br />
While I worked deck-chairs on the beach

I'd grown up on a street of dirt<br />
Opposite a huge mental hospital<br />
A magical playground of bounty<br />
Of vegetable patches and falling fruit<br />
Where I could make mudpies<br />
And leap into trees<br />
With tomboy joy<br />
As I see it now

Later, another huge hospital.<br />
I worked in psychiatric nursing<br />
Offering kindness to so-called "madness"<br />
Nurturing human dignity<br />
Feeling my femininity<br />
And scrubbing with ether-meth<br />
Until my skin <br />
Turned paper thin

But secretly I dreamed myself<br />
A housewife life<br />
Or of being Brigitte Bardot<br />
Arms overflowing with bunches of flowers<br />
And baguettes

I'd wake up and look in the mirror and think<br />
No. That's not me. Not "he". I'm not that.<br />
On the other side of the looking glass<br />
Alice<br />
Was calling

For such a long while<br />
I stopped smiling

Many years went by<br />
And the feelings grew<br />
And I knew<br />
I had to step through<br />
To the other side<br />
It was do or die

I wanted to watch my transformation<br />
To be awake for the operation<br />
This ordeal<br />
To reveal<br />
The real me<br />
This wondrous birth<br />
That would make the pain worth it

They wouldn't let me

But the plaster cast<br />
Of my new sculpted self<br />
Sits on my windowsill<br />
I hope the estate agent<br />
Didn't notice

I couldn't bank – they said I was someone else<br />
Couldn't vote – they said I didn't exist<br />
But as Alice I felt more alive than ever

I always dream in black and white<br />
But now I live in colour<br />
Feeling freed<br />
Dancing in red stilettos<br />
'Til my feet bleed<br />
Sometimes a blue-haired beauty<br />
In a fabulous flowered frock<br />
Or a green goddess in the garden<br />
My plot chock-a-block<br />
With courgettes and runner beans

Now I'm Alice, here in my Wonderland<br />
Trusting in womankind<br />
And the kindness of women<br />
The wonder of women<br />
When you come to something late<br />
Every little bit of it tingles

*This was written after interviewing Alice Denny, a poet, whose transition came later in life.*
