*I met a local Kurdish shopkeeper from Turkey. This is his story.*

I was born<br/>
In a mountain valley<br/>
By the sweet, sweet waters of the Munzur River

I was born<br/>
A beekeeper's son<br/>
Every day a honeycomb breakfast

When I was five<br/>
And gathering herbs<br/>
I disturbed<br/>
A hive<br/>
Hundreds stung me<br/>
I was lucky to survive

But being beestung makes you stronger<br/>
And Kurdish honey makes you live longer

When I was twelve,<br/>
I was sent with a tent<br/>
To work the hives<br/>
On the mountainside<br/>
Beestung daily

But being beestung makes you stronger<br/>
And Kurdish honey makes you live longer

When I was eighteen<br/>
I read newspapers<br/>
Full of fire<br/>
That was enough to get me jailed

I wasn't that political then<br/>
But I met my uncle in the cell<br/>
And I joined the protest hunger strikes

When I was a student<br/>
My hunger grew<br/>
For change and justice for the Kurdish people<br/>
I was jailed again

To steal our souls<br/>
They moved us into solitary cells<br/>
And the torture was brutal

When you're younger<br/>
You think you can save the world<br/>
You think you're stronger<br/>
This time a longer hunger strike<br/>
Only drinking salt and sugarwater

We call it a 'death fast'<br/>
The best we could give to the fight<br/>
Was our bodies<br/>
If we wanted to win<br/>
Some of us had to die<br/>
Or so we thought<br/>
That's how we fought the state<br/>
Inside and outside of prison<br/>
Hundreds fasted<br/>
Many died

My death fast lasted one hundred and fifty days

Your brain shrinks<br/>
Your thoughts circle<br/>
You lose your balance<br/>
You lose your memory<br/>
You lose your self<br/>
But not your belief

And being beestung makes you stronger<br/>
And Kurdish honey makes you live longer

I got sepsis

When they took me from jail<br/>
To hospital<br/>
I felt I'd failed<br/>
Sold my soul<br/>
Betrayed the cause<br/>
By accepting treatment

But wheeled out on the stretcher<br/>
The shortest moment<br/>
In honey-gold sun<br/>
All leaves, all trees<br/>
I heard voices of birds<br/>
And I knew why<br/>
I didn't have to die<br/>
I had life to live, to live.

I escaped<br/>
Trafficked through Bulgaria<br/>
Walked to Greece<br/>
Ferryboat to Italy<br/>
Train to France<br/>
And England<br/>
Where I got political asylum

Became a British citizen<br/>
Ran a little shop<br/>
Selling newspapers<br/>
And sticky sweets<br/>
And Happy Shopper honey<br/>
And while the years passed<br/>
I forgot my trial back in Turkey<br/>
Still running all these years later

One day some men came into my shop<br/>
Undercover police<br/>
Still hunting me all these years later<br/>
Arrested, tagged for six months,<br/>
But cleared<br/>
I'm a political refugee<br/>
I'm only a criminal in Turkey

Who would know<br/>
In my little shop<br/>
That I was born a beekeeper's son<br/>
In a mountain valley by the Munzur River?
