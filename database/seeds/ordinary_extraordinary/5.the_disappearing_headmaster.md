I come from a land<br/>
Where corruption is king<br/>
Where killing is casual<br/>
Where hunger is usual<br/>
Where dead people vote<br/>
Where being a female is always a danger<br/>
A land rich in murderers and millionaires

I trained in survival skills<br/>
I trained as a paramedic<br/>
Never dreamed I'd need<br/>
to save my own life

I was a Headmaster<br/>
And a Scout leader<br/>
I saw hope and trust in children's eyes<br/>
We built rafts from rubbish<br/>
And ancient temples from papier mache<br/>
But I wanted to help build a better world

So we built a new political party<br/>
I saw hope and trust in people's eyes<br/>
We galvanized change<br/>
We mobilized youth<br/>
But change is a dangerous thing...

We were infiltrated<br/>
They shot my friend in the legs<br/>
Then cut his throat

I knew<br/>
I'd<br/>
Be<br/>
Next

Had to get away<br/>
Promised my family a holiday<br/>
to England<br/>
I saw hope and trust in my daughters' eyes<br/>
Made it sound the trip of a lifetime<br/>
They didn't know I was clutching a lifeline<br/>
In this, our one-way ticket

We left without explanation<br/>
Family home abandoned<br/>
School suddenly headmasterless<br/>
And immigration<br/>
A tunnel to the unknown

I know I'm lucky to be alive<br/>
But life is in limbo<br/>
I can't work<br/>
I can't put down roots<br/>
They could send me back<br/>
At any moment<br/>
And that would be<br/>
A death sentence<br/>
For me

But I don't stop dancing<br/>
Don't stop trusting<br/>
Don't stop hoping<br/>
We can build a world<br/>
Where my daughters<br/>
Can dance with their dreams<br/>
Without danger
