We know hunger<br />
We know what it feels like as kids<br />
To find the fridge empty<br />
Except for alcohol<br />
We know what it's like to grow up on the streets<br />
Where Mum and Dad were drinking

We know how tough<br />
It is to sleep rough<br />
We've lived that a little too

I sorted myself<br />
Running a cleaning company<br />
And programming computers<br />
Worked hard, too hard<br />
Til I crashed<br />
A breakdown<br />
Shaking for three months in my bed

But I started to feel the world differently<br />
See all the pain and the poverty<br />
Instead of the poundsigns<br />
As if I'd been blind before<br />
And now I could see<br />
My reason to be here<br />
I could find my strength

We know hunger<br />
Me and my brother<br />
So we take food to children's and adult centres<br />
And most nights a week<br />
We're out on the streets<br />
With the homeless<br />
Serving good food that shops would throw away<br />
To people who too often get turned away<br />
Hot meals, warm clothes<br />
For those<br />
Who get left in the cold

Sure, some of them are using<br />
But you need to know their story

My brother knows addiction<br />
But he got through<br />
Living proof they can do it too<br />
I'm so proud of my brother

Sometimes, months later,<br />
Someone comes in a suit<br />
So smart we hardly recognize them<br />
But they'll cuddle us both so hard<br />
And say: "You know you saved my life."

There are abandoned playgrounds here<br />
We want to make them community gardens<br />
Change cracked concrete to cabbages<br />
And potatoes

We want people to know<br />
All the goodness<br />
You can find in your own garden

We want to show<br />
That from broken places<br />
Beautiful things can grow
