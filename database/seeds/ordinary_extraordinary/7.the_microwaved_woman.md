It was never my plan<br/>
To live in a van

But a building for me cannot now be home<br/>
In a zone with wi-fi my symptoms soar sky-high

I'm a 'universal reactor'<br/>
Almost anything can be a factor<br/>
In making me sick<br/>
Everything prickles, tickles, torments<br/>
Chemicals are crippling<br/>
And I feel electromagnetic waves rippling<br/>
Through my brain

I can sense your mobile phone<br/>
I can feel the invisible<br/>
And the whirling world's so busy<br/>
It makes me dizzy<br/>
With its constant communications

So many things cause palpitations<br/>
Or nosebleeds<br/>
Smart meters stupefy me<br/>
And the Lynx effect has a jinx on me<br/>
My throat restricts<br/>
I fall in fits and lose myself<br/>
Bruise myself all over<br/>
Or my skin burns and turns red<br/>
Til I look cooked<br/>
By this microwaved world

In the madness of modernity<br/>
Everything is felt by me<br/>
With my spider sensitivity<br/>
As if every thread of the world wide web<br/>
Were tugging

They call us the canaries<br/>
In the coalmine<br/>
Warning that our world<br/>
Is turning toxic

Like the Princess and the Pea<br/>
Everything is so felt by me<br/>
If only the world were made of glass

And it's not just chemical or electrical

I was an aromatherapist<br/>
Used to love the smell of honeysuckle<br/>
Now perfumes and pollens make me buckle<br/>
The scent of jasmine and orange no longer sweet

So tired of feeling so wired to the world<br/>
I moved to a seaside carpark<br/>
A quiet place washed by wind and wave<br/>
My van is my bubble<br/>
The southwest wind my oxygen

Strangers have been angels<br/>
Bringing me food when I couldn't walk<br/>
Speaking for me when I couldn't talk<br/>
And the friend who has been my voice to the outside<br/>
Lives on a seaside bench himself<br/>
A comrade in homelessness

The sea-breeze frees me<br/>
Brings some ease<br/>
My seizures here are not so strong<br/>
I start to belong to myself again<br/>
But they may move me on<br/>
Please â€“ let me have some peace
