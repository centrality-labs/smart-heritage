So lightning never strikes twice?<br/>
Oh, it did.<br/>
First time I was six<br/>
In a field barefoot<br/>
Flung sky high<br/>
Electrified<br/>
Died<br/>
For two minutes<br/>
Dad<br/>
Revived me<br/>
But the bolt<br/>
Made me feel more alive than ever<br/>
The world seemed suddenly jewelled<br/>
In rainbow light

Once the lightning<br/>
Has stung you<br/>
Sung you<br/>
Blistered through you<br/>
It has claimed you<br/>
It will find you again

Second time<br/>
I was seventeen<br/>
Drawn to the storm<br/>
Thrown 'cross the room<br/>
Shocked again<br/>
To be lightning's dumbstruck bride

At first I didn't know my own power<br/>
Shocked colleagues as I shook their hands<br/>
Gave lovers an electric kiss

The lick of the lightning still lingers<br/>
I still tingle when a storm draws near<br/>
And anger gets me extra charged<br/>
And makes my static hair stand up on end

I fizzle at my fleshbound children<br/>
To hug I hold a wooden spoon<br/>
Sometimes I don't let people near<br/>
For fear that I might hurt them

At work I wear a "strap-on"<br/>
To tap upon the keyboard<br/>
As I often blow a fuse

Always need to ground myself<br/>
So the heavenly power inside me<br/>
Is earthed

People say: "You're amazing"<br/>
"No" I say<br/>
"It<br/>
Just<br/>
Hurts."
