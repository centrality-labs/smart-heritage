Lightning never strikes twice<br/>
Oh, it did.<br/>
First time I was eight<br/>
Flung sky high<br/>
Electrified<br/>
Died<br/>
For two minutes<br/>
Dad<br/>
Revived me<br/>
But the bolt<br/>
Made me feel more alive than ever

Once the lightning<br/>
Has stung you<br/>
Sung you<br/>
Blistered through you<br/>
It has claimed you<br/>
It will find you again

Second time<br/>
I was sixteen<br/>
Glimpsed the flash of a world<br/>
Of pure energy and light<br/>
Shocked again<br/>
To be lightning's dumbstruck bride

At first didn't know my own power<br/>
Shocked colleagues as I shook their hands<br/>
Gave lovers an electric kiss<br/>
Now I crackle at my human husband<br/>
I fizzle at my fleshbound children<br/>
To hug I hold a wooden spoon<br/>
At work I wear a "strap-on"<br/>
To tap upon the keyboard<br/>
In case I blow a fuse<br/>
Always needing to ground myself<br/>
So the heavenly power inside me<br/>
Is earthed

People say: "You're amazing"<br/>
"No" I say<br/>
"It<br/>
Just<br/>
Hurts."
