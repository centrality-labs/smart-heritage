This sound project for mobile phones introduces real-life stories collected from the streets around us. Everywhere 'ordinary' people are being or doing something a little 'extraordinaryâ€™. This is a celebration of tiny tales of local wonder folk, inviting you to experience what it feels like in their shoes.

Listen with the author (Rosanna Lowe) @ *Hi-Store Coffee Shop*, 7th September 2019.
