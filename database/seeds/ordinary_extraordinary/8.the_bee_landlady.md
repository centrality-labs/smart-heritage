In early evening's honeyed light<br/>
Here amidst the tangled oaks<br/>
I smoke the bees<br/>
With the lavender<br/>
They love

I hum to the hives<br/>
To honour their being<br/>
I harmonise<br/>
With the mesmerizing rise and fall<br/>
Of beebuzz music

I brush the hives so tenderly<br/>
Nothing rushed<br/>
Each moment<br/>
Each movement mindful<br/>
I watch bees gently sip<br/>
On drops of gold

In the heart of the buzzing broodbox<br/>
They busy round their Queen<br/>
Who breeds and leads the bees<br/>
Through motherlove

I do not clip her wings or paint her<br/>
And I hardly harvest honey<br/>
I am simply a landlady<br/>
Trading a well-swept home<br/>
For a little liquid gold<br/>

I've always had<br/>
A yearning for learning<br/>
I bring people to the woods<br/>
To be with bees<br/>
Teenagers<br/>
And refugees<br/>
And tiny children young as three<br/>
Bees can put the softest smile<br/>
On the toughest teenager's face

Bees teach<br/>
Life and death<br/>
The sweet and the sting<br/>
The awe and the fear<br/>
The being-ness of being here<br/>
In the moment

Bees teach timelessness<br/>
They live for six weeks<br/>
And for one hundred million years<br/>
Such purpose<br/>
In their short-lived lives<br/>
Such energy<br/>
In the thriving hives

Bees teach believing<br/>
Bees teach belonging

And when the busy buzzing calms<br/>
The silence still hums<br/>
With the bliss<br/>
And the blessing<br/>
Of bees
