This Summer<br/>
I had seventeen babies<br/>
Seventeen<br/>
In two weeks

Sometimes they fall from their mothers<br/>
Who birth their babies upside down<br/>
And breastfeed them mid-flight

Sometimes babies stay<br/>
When a colony flies away<br/>
If the roost has got too hot

It's been a bad year for bats

As a child I always brought animals home<br/>
Lost frogs, broken birds<br/>
Sticklebacks that ate my goldfish

As an adult, when I was bereaved,<br/>
I went to work in Bodiam Castle<br/>
Found my grieving relieved<br/>
By fluttering bats<br/>
In the cool and the calm of the tower

I used to be a psychiatric nurse<br/>
And now I'm the batty bat-whisperer<br/>
Who flies out in the batmobile<br/>
Whenever a batcall comes

Trapped bats<br/>
Cat-attacked bats<br/>
Bats in buckets and baths and brambles<br/>
They home with me for healing<br/>
Or hibernation

I cream their wings with aloe vera<br/>
I trim their tiny toenails<br/>
And I sever the heads from their mealworms<br/>
Who like to bite bats back

They're all characters<br/>
Pips are the chatterers<br/>
Not laid back like the natterers<br/>
Long-ears are the drama queens<br/>
Seratines find great ways to bite

When they seem ready to release to the roost<br/>
My living room is the poo-strewn site<br/>
Of the bat flight test

Once I nursed a young female<br/>
Who refused to fly<br/>
I found out why<br/>
When she screamed at me

She had just given birth

With time, she taught her baby to fly<br/>
Got him stretching his wings and<br/>
Tiny handstanding
And flitting and swooping<br/>
And darting and landing<br/>
But as soon as he knew<br/>
And he flew<br/>
She<br/>
Stopped

It was his turn to nurture<br/>
And nudge her and budge her<br/>
And nuzzle her gently<br/>
Back to batness<br/>
And help her find her wings

And when finally<br/>
The two flew together<br/>
My heart fluttered fast as their flight
