*Sometimes on a grey day in Hastings, you might glimpse a figure in a rainbow suit or butterfly wings. This is his story.*

I wasn't always Technicolour<br/>
I worked in a factory<br/>
Made boring boots<br/>
In deadly shades<br/>
A shy-boy<br/>
A quiet standing-by boy

It started with a party<br/>
I had a drink<br/>
I didn't know what was in it

Two days later<br/>
Woke up<br/>
Naked<br/>
Limbs locked<br/>
Mind blocked<br/>
No memory<br/>
of what was done<br/>
to me

I hope I never remember<br/>
God, I hope I never remember

I don't know how I got out of there<br/>
But the darkness came with me<br/>
A year of fear<br/>
Life in negative<br/>
They'd made me HIV positive

I decided to hide<br/>
And inside my cocoon<br/>
The old me was dissolving

But slowly, a new self was forming<br/>
Technicolour Dreamboy<br/>
Knew to push through<br/>
To the light again<br/>
Shimmering sequins<br/>
Rippling with rainbow<br/>
Unfolding his clip-on butterfly wings<br/>
And taking first flight<br/>
In a burst of crazy colour

Now I dress to express myself<br/>
I colour myself in<br/>
Parade made up in every shade<br/>
I'm a splash of green<br/>
A flash of glitter<br/>
A Rainbow Warrior<br/>
Bold as the gold of my boots<br/>
Bright as my light-up cape

I strut myself at Pride<br/>
In bellbottoms so wide<br/>
I could camp in them<br/>
My platform heels make me feel<br/>
Six feet high<br/>
I've been seen in magazines,<br/>
On screens, with Drag Queens<br/>
I'm on the scene now<br/>
Big time

If Technicolour Dream Boy<br/>
Can bring one person any joy<br/>
If glitter can bring a glimmer of hope<br/>
If my luminescent wings can lift you up<br/>
As they did me<br/>
It's worth it

I was glittered from head to toe<br/>
When a man came up to me and said<br/>
"You know, you brightened my day.<br/>
I was ready to go to Beachy Head.<br/>
But you<br/>
You changed my mind."
