In 2020, MSL commissioned punk folk musician, Chris Thorpe-Tracey, to be artist-in-residence in the town centre, creating a song-cycle about the fractious period from the end of the Napoleonic Wars up to the clearance of the America Ground, the supposedly illegal settlement in Hastings town centre.

He’s drawn from the stories he found to create A Derelict Chorale, 10 powerful songs which premiered in June 2020 as a live performance on Zoom. The songs open up lives and incidents completely unknown to many in the town.
